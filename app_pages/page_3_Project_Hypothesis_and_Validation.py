    - **Correlation analysis:** Pearson correlation between OverallQual and SalePrice is approximately 0.79, the largest among all numeric features (see EDA).
    - **Model-based importance:** In the tuned XGBRegressor, gain-based feature importance for OverallQual is 0.676 (67.6%), far exceeding the second-ranked feature GrLivArea at 0.070.
    - **Visual confirmation:** Scatter/box plots show a clear monotonic increase in median and upper-quartile prices with each step up the quality scale.
